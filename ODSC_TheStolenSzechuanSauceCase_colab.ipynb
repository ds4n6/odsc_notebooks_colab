The information in this table represents all the workstation names that appear in the data and how many times they appear. In this way we can see if they are common or exceptional.\n",

IP stands for \"Internet Protocol,\" which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network. The information in this table represents all the IP addresses that appear in the data and how many times they appear. This way we can see, again, if they are common or exceptional.\n",
    " - **FIRST table**: The Target User Name column indicates the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on. On the Timestamp column we can see the first time that the user logged on. This gives us valuable information because we can actually see if its a new user or a common one.\n",
    " - **LAST table**: In this case the information provided is the same as in the previous table but with the last time that the user logged on.\n",
    " - **STATS table**: The information in this table represents all the Target User Names that appear in the data and how many times they appear. In this way we can see if they are common or exceptional.\n",
    " - **SID table**: A SID is a number used to identify user, group, and computer accounts in Windows. They're created when the account is first made in Windows and no two SIDs on a computer are ever the same. This table shows us the user name matching its SID."
